#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
##Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
###Determine the results of campaigns based on Launch Dates and Goals
##Analysis and Challenges
###Initial assumptions on campaigns with lower goals being more successful would seem to be true. There is a range of higher goals that were similarly successful.
###Campaigns by launch date shows a trend that starting a campaign at certain times of the year coulb be beneficial.
##Results
May was the best time to launch campaigns. Summer months also were good times to begin. December was the worst time to launch campaigns.
Overall, regarding Outcomes based on Goals, the lower the goal the better chance of success.
The Limitations with these charts do not take in enough comparable data to accurately predict successful campaigns.
I'd suggest an analysis of the three most successful months and the range of goal amounts in them. I'd also suggest a deeper analysis of the goal range of $35,000 to $44,999 that showed a success rate comparable to much lower goals.
